# data-structs-algos
Data structures and algorithms, explained in a few different language categories. I will attempt to represent at least one OO, one (semi- or purely- ) functional, and one procedural language for each concept.

Currently, you will find the following languages represented here and there (no gaurantees that every algorithm or data structure will be represented in every language listed):
* Swift
* Java
* Kotlin
* Go
* Javascript
* Haskell
