# data-structs-algos
Data structures and algorithms, explained in a few different language categories.
The goal is to represent at least one Object-Oriented, one functional(ish), and one procedural language for each concept.

Caveat: I make no gaurantees that every algorithm or data structure will be represented in every language listed below.
* Swift
* Java
* Kotlin
* Go
* Javascript
* Haskell
